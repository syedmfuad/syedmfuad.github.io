Welcome to my website. I am a graduate instructor and Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Applied Economics at [Texas Tech University](https://ttu.edu). 
Before that, I earned my B.S. in Finance and Mathematics. 

My [research](research) agenda is broadly focused on developing programmable stochastic models of resource 
use behavior to inform resource policy via high-resolution data. As an applied microeconomist, 
my research strengthens the data-policy pathway by using applied econometric and machine 
learning methods, first by collecting unique, high-resolution data, and then by applying advanced 
techniques that often require high quality, high-resolution data.

My academic work has been [published](publications) in *Food Policy*. Current projects, including working papers, can be found [here](research). 
Requests for drafts of complete working papers are welcome. Please email me to request a draft. A copy of my CV can be found [here](/files/pdf/FuadSyed_CV_04152023.pdf).

I have [teaching](teaching) experience in statistics and have TA-ed in graduate-level quantitative methodology and undergraduate-level finance.
